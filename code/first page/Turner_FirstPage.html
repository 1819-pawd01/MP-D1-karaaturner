        <p>Over this past summer, I traveled to Bethany Beach. I stayed for a week. My favorite part about going to the beach is walking on the boardwalk and shopping. I also went to Wildwood, New Jersey for a couple weekends. I like Delaware beaches better, though. When I'm at the beach, I usually wake up earlier than usual to get my day started. I also stay up late to see the sunset and walk on the beach at night. If I'm lucky, I get to see some fireworks on the beach. I love seeing the different sizes and colors of the fireworks at each show.</p>

        <p>My favorite color is blue. I like all variations of blue. Even my room used to be bright blue. My favorite shades of blue are baby blue or royal blue. My favorite TV show is <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> because I want to be in the medical field one day. My favorite animals are elephants. Something my brother and I have <strong>always</strong> wanted is a pet cat. We will never be able to get that cat because everyone in my family is allergic, and now my brother has moved out. I'm hoping once he gets his own apartment, he can adapt a cat so I can visit it. Here is a random quote that I found on the internet:</p>
        <blockquote style="font-size:90%;">Don't cry because it's over,<br />smile because it happened.<br />- Dr. Suess</blockquote>

        <p>I have a dog named Nina. Nina is really small; she's only ten pounds. She has white fur all over except on her ear. Her ear used to be dark black, but as she got older, it became grey. Since my dog is so small, she resembles a rat. My parents don't let me say that near her because she "has feelings just like us." My dog sleeps <em>a lot</em>, almost all day. Her favorite place to sleep is my bed.</p>
